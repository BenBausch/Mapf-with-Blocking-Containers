# Multi-Agent Path-Finding with Blocking Containers

This repository contains my bachelor thesis and the code generated in the process of it. 
I implemented multiple Algorithms and compared the performance and efficency of each. 
I introduce a new kind of Warehouse environment and wrote a formal specification of it.
I conducted experiments on the individual Algorithms used and planning from the agent and the containers perspectiv.
